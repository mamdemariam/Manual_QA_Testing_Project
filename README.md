# Manual QA Testing on Demo Websites

## Overview
This project showcases my skills in manual QA testing, focusing on test case execution and bug reporting. The objective is to demonstrate my ability to identify, document, and categorize software defects while ensuring that the websites meet functional and usability standards. Although demo websites were used, they simulate real-world scenarios, providing a practical testing environment.

## Key Features
- **Test Case Design and Execution**: Comprehensive manual testing with detailed test cases for functional and usability aspects.
- **Bug Reporting**: Detailed bug reports with severity and priority classification, highlighting critical issues found during testing.

## Tools Used
- **Google Sheets**: For managing and documenting test cases and bug reports.
- **Chrome Browser**: Initial tests were conducted on Chrome. Additional browser testing may be performed in the future.
- **Demo Websites**: Simulated real-world scenarios through demo sites used for QA testing.

## Test Artifacts
The following artifacts are included in this repository:
- **Test Cases**: Documented test cases with step-by-step instructions, expected results, and actual results.
- **Bug Reports**: Comprehensive bug reports, detailing severity, priority, and reproduction steps.

## Sample Test Case Template
The following template is used for documenting test cases in this project:

| Test Case ID | Title               | Preconditions                   | Steps                                   | Expected Result                   | Actual Result                     | Status (Pass/Fail) |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------|
| TC001         | Example Test Case   | User is logged in                | 1. Navigate to the homepage <br> 2. Click on the "Profile" button <br> 3. Edit profile information | Profile information updates successfully | Profile information updated successfully | Pass                |
| TC002         | Example Test Case 2 | User is on the settings page     | 1. Change notification settings <br> 2. Save changes | Notification settings are saved    | Notification settings not saved    | Fail                |

Each test case is documented with its ID, title, prerequisites, steps to execute, expected outcomes, actual results, and pass/fail status. This structured approach ensures clarity and consistency in the testing process.

## Sample Bug Reporting Template
The following template is used for documenting bugs identified during testing:

| Bug ID | Title            | Description                     | Test Case Number | Severity | Priority | Environment  | Expected Result              | Actual Result                | Preconditions              | Steps to Reproduce                               | Status | Assigned To | Reported By | Date Reported | Attachments |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|----------|----------|---------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| BUG001 | Example Bug      | Brief description of the bug    | TC001             | Medium  |   Medium  | Chrome 127.0.6533.100 (64-bit)| Expected outcome description | Actual outcome description| User is logged in          | 1. Step one <br> 2. Step two <br> 3. Observe result | Open   | [Name]      | [Your Name] | [Date]        | [File Link] |
